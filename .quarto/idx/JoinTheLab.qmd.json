{"title":"MSc By Research","markdown":{"headingText":"MSc By Research","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"We welcome enquiries from anyone interested in cognitive neuroscience - irrespective of your academic background, if you have a particular interest there's usually a route into joining the lab. For all research degrees you will have to apply via the [Middlesex University research degree application process](https://www.mdx.ac.uk/study-with-us/postgraduate/apply-for-research-degrees).However, if you do want to apply for a research degree please [contact us](ContactUs.qmd) first and we can see if our research interest are compatible and make sure your time here is valuable. We have two research degree programmes that run from within the lab.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\nMake sure you [contact us](ContactUs.qmd) before applying for a research degree.\n:::\n\n\nOur [MSc by research](https://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/cognitive-neuroscience-research) pathway has been running for several years now. Many of our candidates go on to persue a careed in academia but some have used it as stepping stones in their careers in other sectors too. If you're confident you want to go on to complete a PhD in cognitive neuroscience and have only just completed your undergraduate (in psychology, neuroscience or related degree) - we think this programme is perfect for you.\n\n[![](images/MScRes.png)](https://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/cognitive-neuroscience-research)\n\n## PhD\n\nAlex, Jon and Emma have all supervised a number of PhD students to completion and welcome any interest in completing doctoral research in the lab. Please check out our publications and specific interests to see if they fit with your goals and then get in touch - we're always happy to have a chat about potential projects and collaborations. Sadly, Middlesex don't offer anything in the way of a bursary - and we don't currently have external funding for PhD students, this means you'd need to self fund. We're doing our best to change this and when we have funds available to us we'll be loud about it!\n\n## Taught Programmes\n\nAlex and Jon designed and lead the MSc in Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience at Middlesex University. As well as overseeing the programme they teach a core module and lead most of the dissertation projects. Alex, Jon & Emma also lead a number of core modules associated with undergraduate programmes in the [Psychology department at. Middlesex university](https://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/psychology). If you're an undergraduate Psychology student at Middlesex - Emma's final year optional module on Memory is highly recomended. You are welcome to apply to any taught programme without reaching out to us first, but if you do have any questions feel free to get in touch.\n\n## MSc Cognitve & Clinical Neuroscience\n\nOur MSc in Cognitive & Clinical Neuroscience has been running since October 2022 and we are proud to offer a unique blend of experimental, clinical, practical and theoretical approaches to learning about Neuroscience. Whilst we lead the module we have borrowed on expertise from our colleagues in both Psychology and Natural sciences departments to offer a real blend of cognitive and clinical neuroscience. [Application can be made directly to the university](https://www.mdx.ac.uk/study-with-us/postgraduate/apply-for-taught-courses) but feel free to contact us if you have any questions.\n\n[![](images/MScCCN.png)](https://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/cognitive-neuroscience-research)\n\n## Research Assisstants and Internships\n\nWe aren't currently hiring any assistants but keep an eye on our twitter feed - if we get any funding we're usually quite vocal about it! If you want to complete a voluntary internship as part of a higher education programme we've had great success with this in the pass so [get in touch](ContactUs.qmd) and we'll see what we can set up.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":true,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"JoinTheLab.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
