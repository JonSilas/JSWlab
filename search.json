She is particularly interested in the relationship between explicit (e.g., recognition) and implicit (e.g., priming) memory, and the effect of aging on these forms of memory.\nWe have a strong belief that the best way to do science and to teach science is to do so collaboratively - expertise and effort can be shared plus… it’s a lot more fun. Whilst we each have our own research interests, endeavors and separate collaborations we find our most successful, interesting and enjoyable work comes from being part of the lab."
